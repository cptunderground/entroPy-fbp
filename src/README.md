# Running client and ISP
    
    python3 client.py name
    
Either you choose an existing name from the feeds/ folder or create your own client

    python3 isp.py name peers
    
For the ISP it functions the same but one peer has to be specified since the ISP communicates with several clients

-> More than one connection will be implemented
