\chapter{Abstract}
Aspiring new technologies emerge every day, one of which is Secure Scuttlebutt (SSB). Secure Scuttlebutt is a peer-to-peer communication protocol based on ID-centric append-only logs (\citet{tarr2019secure}).\footnote{Quelle} The aim of this thesis is to take the mechanics from Secure Scuttlebutt and bring them to a more commercial environment by introducing new intermediary service providers (ISP) which offer connectivity to servers. Having a contract with such an ISP makes the initial onboarding much easier than in SBB. 

By splitting up the ID-centric feeds into feed pairs for every connection, information on the specific dialogs gets bundled and stored independently. Since this is the smallest abstraction, it allows an additional form of bundling by multiplexing log entries together into larger feeds. Therefore the challenge of the immense replication work done by SSB is approached differently.
