\chapter{Abstract}
Aspiring new technologies emerge every day, one of which is Secure Scuttlebutt. Secure Scuttlebutt is a peer-to-peer communication protocol based on ID-centric append-only logs [\citenum{tarr2019secure}]. To spread information around the network, the log of an identity is replicate to its peers, which makes it possible for non-peers to discover new identities [\citenum{ssbc}].
\\

However, Secure Scuttlebutt has low support for onboarding into the social network. This makes it hard for internet service providers or server to offer their services. The aim of this thesis is to take the mechanics from Secure Scuttlebutt and bring them to a more commercial environment by introducing new intermediary service providers which offer connectivity to servers. Having a contract with such an internet service provider makes the initial onboarding much easier than in Secure Scuttlebutt.

By splitting up the ID-centric feeds into feed-pairs for every connection, information on the specific dialog gets bundled and stored independently. Since this is the smallest abstraction, it allows an additional form of bundling by multiplexing log entries together into larger feeds. Therefore the challenge of the immense replication work done by Secure Scuttlebutt is approached differently.
