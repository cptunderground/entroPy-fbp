\subsection{ISP-Server Contract}
Since your best friend has an other friend the contract is the same as in the Client-ISP Contract.\\\\

\section{Feeds}
Given by Prof. Tschudin explain structure
\section{RPC}
API with all methods in context of feeds and peers
Adapted from RPyC so in the service class all services can be defined and have no impact on
\subsection{Send Request}
Format of request and api of method
\subsection{Read Request}
Format of request and api of method
\subsection{Send Result}
Format of request and api of method
\subsection{Read Result}
Format of request and api of method
\section{Introducing}
how is it implemented
\section{Replication}
Replicator Class that is given to each 'feed' so every time on this feed is operated by wr replicate to predefined location
\section{Multiplexing}
mux package idea is to only pass through the request then write in 'replication' feed and work from there.
also for answering channel
